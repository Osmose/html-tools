;;; specedit.el --- Utilities for editing the HTML5 spec in Emacs

;; Author: Edward O'Connor <eoconnor@apple.com>
;; Keywords: docs, convenience

;;; Commentary:

;; There are basically four things of interest in this file:

;; 1. The command `specedit-insert-boilerplate', which is useful when
;;    replying to Bugzilla bugs.
;; 2. `specedit-mode', a major mode for editing the spec. It syntax
;;    highlights the various processing directives that we use to
;;    generate multiple specs out of the same document.
;; 3. The command `specedit-specs-at-point' will tell you what specs the
;;    character at point appears in. Helpful for when you're trying to
;;    figure out what START or END directives to add/remove.
;; 4. The command `specedit-insert-inert-block-at-point' will insert the
;;    appropriate amount of START and END directives so that the content
;;    they surround will only appear in the given spec.

;;; Code:

(autoload 'format-spec "format-spec")
(autoload 'format-spec-make "format-spec")
